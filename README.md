 ## About The Project

This study explored the use of machine learning models to predict mortality risk among patients diagnosed with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) using retrospective data spanning from 1997 to 2014. The dataset included data from 17,549 adult participants diagnosed with NAFLD and included various demographic, anthropometric, and biochemical parameters for analysis. 
	Out of six machine learning algorithms that we studied, AdaBoost has emerged as the most promising model, achieving near-perfect accuracy (99%) and high precision, recall, and F1 scores.
